Project Description:
Our project is a software that assist students in grade-based calculations. it is a  will help students find out what their final grade will be at the end of the current semester for a given class. This class grade calculator will calculate the final grade from the scores and weights that the user inputs.

Problem Description:
Class grades are extremely important to many students. They are constantly concerned with what their final grade will be for a certain class. Sometimes, it is difficult to find out these things, as the tools are not readily available for the students. Some softwares have a “What If” grade calculator (Canvas), but this is often inaccurate, as the teachers do not have the proper weights initialized. 

That is where this software will come in. This software will give the students the ability to accurately and efficiently find out what they want to know about their grades. 

Stakeholders:
For this software, our primary stakeholders would be college students. In my opinion, college students are more concerned with their grades than students who are not yet in college. However, I do also believe that this software will be of use to students who are not yet in college. Basically, all students who care about their class grades will be the stakeholders for this software. 

Additionally, teachers could also be a potential stakeholder for this project. They could introduce their students to the grade calculator at the beginning of the semester, and let them know that they could use it to find out their grade throughout the semester.
